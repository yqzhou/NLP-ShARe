Pericardial effusion

The left atrium is moderately dilated

The left atrium is elongated

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL The right atrium is moderately dilated

There is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy

The left ventricular cavity size is normal

Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal

The right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied

Right ventricular chamber size is normal

Right ventricular systolic function is normal

The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened

There is mild mitral annular calcification

Mild tricuspid regurgitation is seen

There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion

The effusion appears circumferential

Limited focused study

The left atrium is moderately dilated

The left atrium is elongated

right atrium is moderately dilated

is severe symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy

The left ventricular cavity size is normal

Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal

Resting regional wall motion abnormalities include basal and mid septal hypokinesis

right ventricular free wall is hypertrophied

Right ventricular chamber size is normal

Right ventricular systolic function is normal

aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened

No color doppler study was done to assess for the presence of MR Name Name

The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened

is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension

There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion

The effusion appears circumferential

An echogenic density in the right ventricle is present consistent with a pacemaker lead

Compared with the findings of the prior study of the pericardial effusion is much less

The overall function is unchanged
